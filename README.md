Deep Learning for Diabetes.
This project is trained from teh "Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset", and is trying to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on medical measurements.

The outcome column of dataset represent whether someone has diabetes (1) or not (0), which is the output, and the inputs that lead to it are patient's medical data siuch as pregnancies, BMI, Glucos, etc.
